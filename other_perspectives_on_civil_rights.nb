init other perspectives on civil rights:
push nation of islam:
    created to promote black nationalism, self-discipline, and self-reliance
    It believed that people of African descent were culturally and morally superior to whites.
    And they advocated for the separation of the races.
    The Nation of Islam also encouraged members to take new Muslim names.
    This was in order to reject the family names that were forced onto their enslaved ancestors.
    Finally, the Nation of Islam stated that aggressive actions were acceptable to win equality.
    push Malcolm X:
        advocated winning equality by any means necessary
        implied use of violence
        gave fiery speeches to his supporters
        advocated for black nationalism and separatism
        he began to retreat from those views later on in his life.
        He believed that the Nation of Islam could work together with organizations that were headed by Martin Luther King in order to win social justice for African Americans.
        In 1964, Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam.
        He felt that the Nation of Islam had views with which he 
        could no longer agree.
        He also no longer believed in the separatist beliefs of the Nation of Islam.
        He now believed that Islam served people of many races and could unify people of different races.
        This happened after he traveled the world and met with other Muslims and civil rights leaders.
        Tensions continued between Malcolm X and 
        the Nation of Islam.
        He received several death threats and acts of violence against him.
        This picture shows Malcolm X getting out of a car at his house which had been firebombed the night before.
        A week after this incident, he would be shot and killed in Harlem in 1965.
        Three members of the Nation of Islam were 
        convicted of his murder.
        Malcolm X left a lasting impact on parts of the civil rights movement.
        Malcolm X's ideas about black pride and fighting against racial oppression would influence the Black Power movement.
        Unlike other civil rights leaders, Malcolm X had no problem calling out the injustices that were committed 
        against African Americans.
        Some of Malcolm X's ideas focused on the freedom and autonomy to control one's situation.
        He thought that we didn't have to rely on others for help.
        Malcolm X believed that African Americans could control their own situation.

swap black power movement:
    As the civil rights movement progressed, some of the organizations that had originated within began to change.
    This included the SNCC.
    Remember that the SNCC was created in 1960.
    They staged sit-ins and organized the Freedom Rides, Freedom Summer, and the March on Washington.
    In 1966, Stokely Carmichael became the leader of the SNCC.

    His belief in promoting black power created problems within the organization.
    Those who believed in non-violence, including many white members, would soon be alienated or pushed aside as Carmichael led the SNCC into a more militant era.
    In this picture Carmichael is talking to African American college students about the idea of black power.
    Carmichael was born in Trinidad in 1941 and moved to 
    New York City when he was 11.
    After he attended Howard University, he became involved with the civil rights movements of the early 1960s.
    Carmichael, who you see pictured here, is credited with coining the phrase "Black Power." As a Freedom Rider, Carmichael became a leader of the SNCC in 1966.
    He would eventually lead the SNCC's shift from non-violence 
    to a more militant or aggressively active position.
    Let's take a look now at the SNCC and what purpose it served during the civil rights movement.


    The Black Power Movement itself became stronger as radical members of the SNCC began to break away.
    Remember, the Black Power Movement promoted self-reliance among African Americans.
    And the Movement believed that African Americans could solve their own problems.
    This caused a split in the civil rights movement.
    In the past, organizations like the SCLC and NAACP have 
    relied on alliances with sympathetic whites.
    As a leader of The Black Power Movement, Carmichael called for African Americans to create their own political organizations.
    These groups, according to Carmichael, did not need participation by whites nor did they need to be integrated.
    In this picture, you see Stokely Carmichael at 25.

    He was the leader of the SNCC.
    And he was speaking at the University of California.
    During this speech, he coined the phrase, "to hell with the draft."
swap black panthers:
    1966
    was based in oakland, CA
    the entire community was responsible for solving it's own problems
    called for racial and economic equality
    push violence:
        In 1967, Huey Newton was jailed for the death of a police officer
        And after this event, the Black Panthers began to promote violence as an option
        Confrontations with police became more common
        And hundreds of members were arrested and jailed for various crimes, which included murder
        The Black Panther Party would soon call on African Americans to fight back against oppression
        But members also used nonviolent protests to speak out.
        In the picture, you see an example of this, as a member of the Black Panther Party is protesting at the Lincoln Memorial.

swap INCREASING violence:
    frustraction continued to exist and increase
    informal segregation still existed
    thus anger grew
    watts riots caused by african american being arrested by white officers
    people in Watts were also angry and frustrated over unemployment, poor living conditions, police brutality, and widespread racism.
    This occurred on August 12, 1965.
    The Watts Riots lasted for six days, and the final death toll was 34.
    But there were around 1,000 injuries.
    Businesses were destroyed, and there were around 3,500 arrests.
    Racial tension continued to grow, and violence began to spread
swap riots:
    Race riots in the United States would continue throughout the 1960s.
    The violent riots that would follow the Watts Riots would deem the summer of 1967 the "long hot summer." The reasons for these riots was very similar to those of the Watts Riots.
    People were angry about unequal education, unequal standards of living, and unequal economic
    opportunities.
    In the summer of 1967, over 150 riots would occur all over the United States.
    Large riots occurred in both Detroit, Michigan and Newark, New Jersey
    The violent 1967 Newark Riots left 23 people killed, 725 people injured, over 1,000 arrested, and caused the city $10 million in damages.
    The riot in Detroit proved to be more deadly than the Watts Riots.
    In 1967, the Detroit Riot was one of the summer's largest race riots.
    The riots began on the morning of July 23, 1967 and lasted
    for 5 days.
    43 people died and more than 1,200 were injured.
    The Detroit police, the National Guard, and the US Army were called in to restore order.
    As a result of the riots, President Johnson formed a commission to explore the reasons behind the riots.
