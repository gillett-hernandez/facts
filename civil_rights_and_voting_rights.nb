init civil rights and voting rights:
:lesson question: what were the causes and effects of major civil rights legislation in the 1960s
:topics: the march on washington -> the civil rights act
:topics: the selma marches -> the voting rights act
In the years that followed the Civil War, African Americans struggled to obtain the rights that were granted to them by the US Constitution.
Social attitudes and barriers did not fall easily.
And by the 1960s the civil rights movement had reached its climax as African Americans demanded equal rights at the voting polls and elsewhere.
One of the most important events in the civil rights movement was the march on Washington.
This is where Dr.
Martin Luther King gave one of the most influential speeches in history, his "I have a Dream" speech
push achievements up to 1963:
    public school segregation was outlawed, and the process of desegregating public schools and universities was well under way.
    many public accommodations, such as buses, had been desegregated.
    Others had been segregated through actions such as sit-ins or the Montgomery bus boycott.
    Rosa Parks.
    She was a key figure in Montgomery bus boycott.
    Many public accommodations, like movie theaters, restaurants, and hotels were still segregated, and there were barriers to voting rights for African Americans that were still in existence.
    The 24th Amendment, which would outlaw poll taxes, had not yet been ratified.
swap march on washington:
    :date: august 28, 1963
    push goals:
        celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the emancipation proclamation
        protest racial discrimination and demand legal equality
        president kennedy -- insist on passage of major civil rights legislation
        200,000 attendees
        white and african american supporters
        it was organized, peaceful, and focused on a clear set of goals
    swap historical events:
        martin luther king jr speech
        :appeals: to emotions, by his referring to children
        :appeals: to ethics, by his repeated references to the declaration of independence, the constitution, and the bible
    swap impact:
        watched by millions of americans on television
        positively influenced national opinion in support of civil rights
        helped ensure the passage of the civil rights act
    pop
swap civil rights act of 1964:
    push reasons:
        african americans still faced discrimination and segregation
        laws in southern states ensured ongoing discrimination
        only federal law could overcome and remove "Jim Crow"
        but opposition to a federal civil rights act was strong
    swap kennedy:
        JFK proposed the first draft of the civil rights act
        called for an end to all segregation in public accommodations and more protections for african americans' voting rights.
        JFK was assassinated and the responsibility was passed on to Lyndon B.
        Johnson
    swap LBJ:
        became president after kennedy was assassinated
        urged congress to pass the civil rights act to honor president kennedy's memory
        became an influential leader with a vision for a "great society"
    swap ..:
        the house strengthened kennedy's bill and passed it
        southern senators tried to prevent a vote through a filibuster
        push filibuster:
            A filibuster occurs when senators who oppose a bill refuse to end the debate and continue making speeches, hoping to prevent a vote on the bill.
            The side proposing the legislation will often back down, but in this case, supporters were willing to withstand the filibuster for as long as necessary.
            The filibuster ended after 83 days.
            And Johnson signed the bill into law on July 2, 1964.
        swap provisions:
            guarantee of equal voting rights
            "No person acting under color of law shall deny the right of any individual to vote in any Federal election."
            The Act also put an end to the segregation of public accommodations and an end to gender discrimination in the workplace.
            Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Act provided new enforcement tools so laws could be effectively enforced.

swap 24th amendment:
    was also ratified in 1964
    it banned federal and state governments from requiring poll taxes in federal elections
    "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax."
    In 1966, a Supreme Court ruling prohibited poll taxes in state elections as well.
swap voting rights in the south:
    push techniques to deny voting rights:
        poll taxes
        literacy tests
        grandfather clauses
        white primary - where african americans were denied the right to participate in nominating candidates
        all of these were used to deny voting rights to african americans
    swap voter advocacy movement:
        The Advocacy Movement was the next focus of the Civil Rights Movement.
        The free exercise of voting rights in the South became the goal of civil rights activists.
        The activists took action by sponsoring voter registration drives.
        You can see an example of a voter registration drive in the picture.
        They also founded organizations like the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.
        But such activity was often met with mob and police violence.
    swap selma marches:
        The Selma march was the next planned demonstration within the Civil Rights Movement.
        In Alabama, voter registration drives led to white resistance and often violence.
        In Selma, for example, in spite of strong efforts, only 2% of eligible African Americans were registered to vote.
        Civil rights leaders responded by planning a 54-mile march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.
        In the picture, you can see Martin Luther King and his wife marching in support of African American suffrage.
        Selma was important because African Americans made up 50% of the population but only 1% of the registered voters.
        Civil rights leaders also responded by helping to force Governor Wallace to secure voting rights for African Americans in Alabama.
        The first march gave rise to two more marches when protesters were met with violence.
        push events:
            :March 7, 1965: marches were attacked by police officers at a Selma bridge
            :March 9, 1965: king then led a memorial march to the bridge
            :March 21-25, 1965: about 25000 marchers finally completed the march to montgomery
        swap effects:
            selma marches helped african americans gain voting rights
            national television coverage created support among the american public
            congress passed the voting rights act of 1965
            "It's all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice, and we shall overcome."
        pop
    swap voting rights act of 1965:
        banned literacy tests
        required federal supervision of vote registration in select areas
        "No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting shall be imposed or applied by any state to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color."
        in 1965, african american voter registration was lower than white registration, but as African American registration increased, so did the number of African Americans elected.
        by 2010, that difference in voter registration rates had almost completely disappeared
