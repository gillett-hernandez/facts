	swap :economy:
		push :inflation:
			consumers wanted items that had been rationed = high demand
			those items were still scarce after = shortage of goods
			factories had to change to consumer goods after having production focused on the war = low supply
			price controls were lifted
			all of these combined = inflation

			When the economy slowed and the war in Korea became a certainty, Truman changed course and worked to grow the economy further than it already had.
			He increased war production again.
			He also maintained the production of consumer goods as well.
			he kept unemployment and inflation low in the time before the Korean War.

		:twenty-second amendment: no more than two terms or could serve more than 10 years
	swap :election of 1948:
		when he ran for reelection, the odds were against him
		truman faced opposition from both parties
		his "whistle stop campaign" energized his democratic base
		:whistle stop campaign: brief stops and visits w/short speeches
		truman won a surprise victory
	swap :legacy:
		many fair deal legislation never passed congress
		bc attention shifted to the cold war
		china became communist in 1949
		SU developed the atomic bomb in 1949
		North korea invaded south korea in 1950
		so thus, americans accused truman of not taking communism seriously
		he decided not to run for reelection in 1952
