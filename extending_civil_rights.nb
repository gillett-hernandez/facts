push american indians:
    During the 1960s, American Indian issues were coming to the forefront.
    In the 1960s, many American Indians were concerned about social and environmental issues.
    These issues included poverty, both on and off the reservation, a lack of educational opportunities, discrimination, and a lack of protection for American Indians' lands.
    American Indians were also American citizens.
    And they felt like their government was failing them.
    While both presidents Kennedy and Johnson made efforts to address the historical wrongdoings, many felt their efforts were inadequate.
    Groups began to step up to try and create change.
    The National Congress of American Indians, or NCAI, was founded in 1944.
    The NCAI took on the task of improving American Indians' lives.
    The NCAI is the largest American Indian organization.
    It represents more than 250 tribes.
    And it monitors government policy on American Indian affairs.
    The organization promotes programs to help improve the lives of American Indians.
    And the NCAI continued to speak out in the 1960s about the issues that you just saw.


    American Indians began to see more public methods of protest and did it in well-known locations such as Alcatraz.
    In 1969, protesters occupied Alcatraz Island, the site of an abandoned federal prison in San Francisco.
    The purpose of this occupation was to bring awareness to the US government's unfair treatment of American Indians.
    They were arguing that a treaty had been broken that allowed American Indians to take and use unwanted government property and Alcatraz was unused property.
    Activists occupied the land for 19 months until government officers removed the remaining protesters.
    The Alcatraz occupation had a direct impact on the fight for American Indian civil rights.
    It attracted public attention to the American Indian cause and forced the government to address the activists' demands.
    It also established a model for future American Indian activism and inspired other American Indian leaders and activists.

    Another major organization was founded in 1968.
    And they fed off of Alcatraz' example.
    The American Indian movement was founded in 1968 to fight for equal rights and better living conditions for American Indians.
    In the picture you see one of their protests in Washington, DC.
    The group was especially critical of the Bureau of Indian Affairs because they felt that it didn't do enough to advance the rights of American Indians.
    The American Indian Movement worked to restore property rights to American Indians.
    And they wanted their treaties with the US government to be enforced.
    A new leader emerged to help lead a protest in Wounded Knee, South Dakota.
    His name was Russell Means.
    Russell Means was born an Oglala Sioux in 1939.
    He joined the American Indian Movement in 1968 to fight for equal rights and improve living conditions for American Indians.
    In 1973, along with Dennis Banks, Means let the occupation of Wounded Knee, South Dakota.

    The Return to Wounded Knee was the next step in the American Indian Movement.
    Wounded Knee, South Dakota was the site of a massacre of Sioux Indians by the US Army in 1890.
    In the picture, you can see a mass grave that was dug after the massacre was over.
    The site and the town that grew there became a well-known symbol of American Indian suffering and oppression.
    In 1973, activists from the American Indian Movement-- including Russell Means-- occupied Wounded Knee to protest federal policies toward American Indians.
    They accused the government of not honoring its treaties.
    And they demanded that negotiations be reopened.
    This demonstration led to some conflict.
    Violence and bloodshed occurred at Wounded Knee when American Indians were unwilling to negotiate.
    Federal agents tried to force the activists out, and both sides exchanged gunfire during a 71-day standoff.
    The image shows American Indians on guard at Wounded Knee.
    Several people were wounded or killed.
    But the incident helped create public sympathy and support for the movement.

    The Chicano Movement and Brown Power was beginning to take shape during this era.
    Many Hispanic Americans, especially those from Mexico, wanted to bring attention to discrimination and other issues that they faced.
    As a result of this desire, Hispanic Americans formed the Chicano Movement.
    Activists often use the term Brown Power to refer to the Chicano Movement.
    This was in reference to the African American Black Power Movement.
    The Chicano Movement pursued many changes.
    Some of these issues included voting rights, immigration reform, labor protections, education, and increasing awareness of a shared culture.
    One important focus of the Chicano Movement was on the rights of migrant workers.
    Farmers hired migrant workers to help harvest their crops.
    But since this work was only needed to be done during certain times of the year, migrants were temporary workers.
    In the United States, migrant workers were typically from Mexico and Central America.
    Because they were not American citizens and had few rights, migrant workers were often paid poorly and faced many hardships, including discrimination.

    One individual who spoke up for migrant farm workers was Cesar Chavez.
    Chavez was born in Arizona to migrant farm workers from Mexico.
    Because their work meant a great deal of travel and not a lot of money, Chavez didn't attend school regularly.
    After serving in the US Navy, Chavez went back to migrant farm work.
    During that same time, he trained as a community organizer in California and then went on to help found the United Farm Workers Labor Union.
    Throughout his life, Chavez always emphasized the power of peaceful, nonviolent protest and activism.
    Another influential individual was Delores Huerta.
    Huerta was born in New Mexico in 1930.
    She lobbied California state legislators to enact legislation for non-citizens.
    Huerta became interested in the conditions of farm workers, and together with Cesar Chavez, they formed the United Farm Workers Labor Union.
    She helped farm workers gain collective bargaining rights with the passage of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act.
    In 1962, Cesar Chavez and Delores Huerta organized the union that would become known as The United Farm Workers of America.
    The UFW focused on job security, higher wages, and better living conditions for migrant workers.
    The union organized boycotts, such as the Grape Boycott that lasted from 1966 to 1970.
    The Grape Boycott proved to be one of the greatest achievements of the UFW.
    The Boycott became a nationwide boycott of California grapes, and it lasted for five years.
    It drew national attention to the problems that were faced by migrant workers.
    And the UFW's efforts in the strike led to improved protections for its workers.
swap asian americans:
    From the time they first came to the United States, Asian immigrants have faced discrimination.
    In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act prohibited all immigration from China.
    In 1907, the United States entered into a "Gentleman's Agreement" with Japan.
    This was a way to restrict Japanese immigration without having to pass a law.
    In the agreement, Japan agreed to restrict passports to immigrants to the United States.
    And the United States agreed to allow children of Japanese descent to attend school with white children.
    And during World War II, some people doubted the loyalty of Japanese Americans.
    This led to hundreds of thousands of Asian Americans losing their livelihoods and property after they were sent to internment camps.
    In the picture, you see a Japanese internment camp during World War II.
    In the 1960s, discrimination against Asian Americans only increased, influencing the creation of the Yellow Power movement.
    At the time, the United States was fighting a war in the Asian country of Vietnam.
    This brought increased discrimination for all Asian Americans since many American soldiers and civilians were being killed.
    And some Americans associated Asian Americans with their enemy, the Vietnamese.
    This type of discrimination led many young Asian Americans and the children of former World War II internees to organize themselves to demand an end to employment discrimination and restrictions on where they could live.
    This movement became known as the Yellow Power movement.

    One way of preserving this culture was by preserving Chinatowns.
    In New York, Asian American activists fought against job and housing discrimination.
    And in San Francisco, Asian Americans worked to preserve cultural areas, since San Francisco was a historic gateway for Asian immigrants.
    In these communities and elsewhere, activists fought to protect the history, architecture, and experiences of those who lived in Chinatowns.
    One of the primary goals of Asian American activists was to preserve and promote their culture, especially in the states of California and Washington where Asian American populations were large.
    They demanded ethnic and regional history classes in colleges and worked to end bias in education.
    They also opposed all stereotypes in the media.
