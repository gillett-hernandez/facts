    swap Cuba:
        One way to think about the Cold War is to think of the world as a great battlefield, not always between fighting, but many times the United States and the Soviets, they competed for influence over new nations around the world.
        Especially newly independent nations, for example, in Africa.
        Or a lot of times countries in Central as well as in South America.
        During this time period, the United States really turned its attention toward this country right here, Cuba, only 90 miles off the coast of Florida.
        Now the United States has had a lot of intervention and involvement in the country of Cuba, especially during this time period when millions of dollars were invested in the Cuban economy.

        They supported the leader of Cuba during this time, a person named Batista.
        But many Cubans living here in, obviously, Cuba, they actually opposed Batista because they didn't want foreign control of their country.
        Many Cubans were actually oppressed by Batista.
        So again, they had another reason to oppose his rule.
        One person who really did a great job 
        of rallying the support of these Cubans was Fidel Castro, whom you see right here.
        He organized a rebel force in the 1950s.
        He formed the 26th of July Movement to oppose Batista.
        Initially he tried to overthrow Batista but was initially unsuccessful and was thrown in jail.
        But that didn't stop him because he led a group that overthrew Batista in 1959.

        With that overthrow he made Cuba a Communist nation.
        The Cuban Revolution of 1959 was a pivotal moment in history, especially for the Western Hemisphere.
        So what happened is Castro overthrew Batista, and he assumes control of Cuba.
        Next, Castro established a Communist state where the government controlled every aspect of the economy, and he formed an alliance with the USSR.
        90 miles away from the United States.
        In response to this, the United States enacted an embargo, which they hoped would force Castro from power.
        It did not allow Americans to trade with or travel to Cuba.
        This would have huge ramifications for that country.

        push Cuban invasion:
            With the overthrow of Batista, the United States began to prepare to invade Cuba.
            But not with the United States military.
            In fact, the CIA had prepared for a planned invasion of Cuba under the previous president, President Eisenhower.
            Who they were training were not US troops, but Cuban exiles who opposed Castro.
            What happens here is that the Kennedy administration, they see this plan, and they actually decide to go ahead with it.
            Right here you can see the Kennedys, right here, and they're actually meeting Cuban exiles who are going to be invading Cuba in this photo right here.
            The place they choose to invade is called the Bay of Pigs, which is located approximately right here in Cuba.
            There were a total of 1,400 exiles who landed there in April of 1961.
            As we said, they landed in the Bay of Pigs.
            But Castro's forces easily repelled them.
            They found out where they were, and they were able to defeat them in only two days.
            Why? How was it so poorly planned? Well, a couple things.
            Intelligence of the Cuban forces was very poor.
            They didn't know how many were there, how many would be able to get to this invasion force.
            There was also little air support for the invaders.
            So because of that, it was a huge failure and a huge embarrassment for the United States.
            It had very severe consequences.
            For one, tensions between the two nations increased, between Cuba and the United States.
            Secondly, Cuba's fear of another invasion, it led them, it almost forced them, into another major crisis in 1962 called the Cuban Missile Crisis.
            Another thing you can see in this image right here is it really drove Fidel Castro and Nikita Khrushchev in the USSR closer together.

    swap Cuban Missle Crisis:
        After the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the United States was very worried about the closer cooperation between the USSR and Cuba.
        In October of 1962, a US spy plane photographed a Soviet missile base in Cuba, and more missile sites were discovered, not just one.
        So Kennedy's team debated whether to launch a military strike or to blockade the island.
        Remember, Cuba is 90 miles off the coast of Florida.
        It's extremely quick to get there, and a missile traveling from Cuba could hit the United States very fast.
        Here you can see one of those spy photographs.
        You can see the erector launch here, some of the equipment, as well as some of the missiles being unloaded.
        Kennedy decided on a naval quarantine, which is a blockade of Cuba.
        But he called it a quarantine.
        Well, why is that? Well, the fact is is that if he calls it a quarantine, it's not an act of war.
        If he calls it a blockade, that would be considered an act of war, and he did not want to start a direct war with the Soviet Union.
        But his actions, they still raised the threat of an armed conflict.
        Here's what he said to the United States in 1962 in a televised speech.
        He says, "All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, will be turned back." So you can see a standoff is starting to take place between the US quarantine and USSR Naval ships or cargo ships that were headed toward Cuba with these missiles.

        The world waited anxiously for five days, especially these people right here who are warning President Kennedy to be careful.
        Most Soviet ships, they avoided, they went around the quarantine.
        But ones that went to or from Cuba? Well, they were definitely searched for weapons.
        And even a minor incident during this time could have started a war.
        So seeing that, finally a secret agreement was signed between the two sides in October.
        What it did is that the Soviet Union would withdraw its missiles from Cuba if the United States, one, lifted its blockade, two, did not invade Cuba again, and three, removed its nuclear missiles from Turkey.
        Turkey is a country that borders the Soviet Union.
        So the Soviet Union wanted those missiles out of Turkey.
        If you look at this image right here, you can see Kennedy and Khrushchev.
        They're trying to keep nuclear war, represented by this monster, in the box.
        And they're able to do that with this secret agreement.
        The aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis
        was quite significant because it was a major turning point in the Cold War.
        For one, the US and the USSR, they established a hotline to encourage direct communication between the USSR and the United States.
        They did that with this phone right here that's on display in a museum.
        If Kennedy picked up this phone, he
        could talk immediately and directly with Khrushchev.
        Also, the world was reminded of the dangers of nuclear war and the tragedy that would take place if nuclear war broke out.
    swap today:
        Today I'm very glad to report that S-Cuban relations are slowly improving.
        Fidel Castro stepped down, and his brother, Raul, who you see right here, is now in control.
        Cuban leaders, they've loosened their control of the economy.
        You see some aspects of capitalism actually taking hold in Cuba.
        And President Obama actually removed some parts
        of the embargo, some of the travel restrictions and some of the importing and exporting of goods to and from Cuba.
        But it still has a long way to go to normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba.
